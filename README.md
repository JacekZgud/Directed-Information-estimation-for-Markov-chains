# Markov_simulations
Code to simulate Markov chains and calculate relevant information theory-based measures. 

## Current Functionalities
1. Markov chain simulation
2. Stationary density calculation
3. Markov chain simulation of selected nodes only
4. Calculate transfer entropy between target nodes and all other

## How to run
All required functions and procedures are present at simulations.R file. 

## Comparison to Ay Polani information flow 
Script for it may be found in mutual_info_comparison.R
